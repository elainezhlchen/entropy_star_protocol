# Quantification of stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte maturity using transcriptomic entropy score

### Introduction 
The inability to quantify cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation remains a significant barrier to evaluating the effects of ongoing efforts to produce adult-like CMs from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). We have developed a single cell RNA sequencing-based metric “entropy score” that indexes PSC-CM maturation status by benchmarking against in vivo references. In this protocol, we detail how to use the entropy score, including applying our R code to user-provided data. This tool can be used to quantify maturation levels of PSC-CMs and potentially other cell types.

For complete details on the scientific rationale behind this method, please refer to the original publication by Kannan et al. at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34534204/
